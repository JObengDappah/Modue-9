# README.md Generator

## Description

  This initiative enables users to craft a professional and high-quality README file through the command line. Built with node.js and the inquirer package, it asks users a series of questions, the answers to which are used to generate the README file. This file is then saved in a folder named 'readme-files', from where users can easily transfer it to their desired project. In cases where the 'readme-files' directory does not exist, the application is designed to automatically create it.
